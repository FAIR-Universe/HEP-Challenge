# Sample code submission
This folder contains the sample code submission
## Description
The main part of the sample code submission is in the `model.py` which contains the `Model` class. 
* The model class uses the BDT classifier using [xgboost](https://xgboost.ai/) defined in [boosted_decision_tree](/sample_code_submission/boosted_decision_tree.py). 
* The statistical analysis part is written in [statistical_analysis](/sample_code_submission/statistical_analysis.py) 

Workings of the Statistical Analysis part can be found in our [whitepaper](https://example.com/whitepaper)
