# Data
***

The dataset is created using the particle physics simulation tools Pythia 8.2 and Delphes 3.5.0. The proton-proton collision events are generated with a center of mass energy of 13 TeV using Pythia8. Subsequently, these events undergo the Delphes tool to produce simulated detector measurements. We used an ATLAS-like detector description to make the dataset closer to experimental data. The events are divided into two groups: 
1. Higgs boson signal ($H \rightarrow \tau \tau$)
2. $Z$ boson background ($Z \rightarrow \tau \tau$) 

### Higgs Signal: 
The Higgs bosons are produced with all possible production modes and decay into two tau leptons. The tau leptons are further allowed to decay into all possible final states. 

### Z boson Background: 
Only background events coming from $Z$ bosons are included in this challenge. While simulating the process, interference effects between $Z$ bosons and photons are included. Similar to signal events, only the tau-tau decay mode of the $Z$ boson is included in the dataset.

> The challenge is considering a scenario of analyzing $139 ~\textrm{fb} ^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment during the Run-II phase (2015-2018) of the LHC.
