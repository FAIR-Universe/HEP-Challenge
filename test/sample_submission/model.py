# Dummy Model Submission

import numpy as np

class Model:
    """
    This is a model class to be submitted by the participants in their submission.

    This class should consists of the following functions
    1) init : 
        takes 2 arguments get_train_set and systematics. It can be used for intiializing variables, classifier etc.
    2) fit : 
        takes no arguments
        can be used to train a classifier
    3) predict: 
        takes 1 argument: test set
        can be used to get predictions of the test set.
        returns a dictionary

    Note:   Add more methods if needed e.g. save model, load pre-trained model etc.
            It is the participant's responsibility to make sure that the submission 
            class is named "Model" and that its constructor arguments remains the same.
            The ingestion program initializes the Model class and calls fit and predict methods

            When you add another file with the submission model e.g. a trained model to be loaded and used,
            load it in the following way:

            # get to the model directory (your submission directory)
            model_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

            your trained model file is now in model_dir, you can load it from here
