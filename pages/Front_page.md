# FAIR Universe - HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge

## Introduction 
The Fair Universe project is organising the **HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge**, which will/has run from Sep to October 2024.

This HEP and Machine Learning competition is the first to strongly emphasise uncertainties: mastering uncertainties in the input training dataset and outputting credible confidence intervals.

The context is the measurement of the $H \rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^-$ cross section like in [HiggsML challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson) in 2014, from a dataset of the 4-momentum signal state. Participants should design an advanced analysis technique that can not only measure the signal strength but also provide a confidence interval, from which correct coverage will be evaluated automatically from pseudo-experiments.

The confidence interval should include statistical and systematic uncertainties (concerning detector calibration, background levels, etc…). It is expected that advanced analysis techniques that can control the impact of systematics will perform best, thereby pushing the field of uncertainty-aware AI techniques for HEP and beyond.

There are several information sources regarding the FAIR Universe - HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge:

*  [Tutorial Slides](https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/tutorials/Higgs_Uncertainty_Challenge-Codabench_Tutorial.pdf) : These slides will help you register and submit a sample dummy submission. 

* [Codabench](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/2977/): This serves as the platform to submit entries to the competition. It hosts the public [training data](https://www.codabench.org/datasets/download/b9e59d0a-4db3-4da4-b1f8-3f609d1835b2/). Also, see the [tutorial slides](https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/tutorials/Higgs_Uncertainty_Challenge-Codabench_Tutorial.pdf) for an explanation of how to use codabench. 

* [Documentation](https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/docs/): This contains detailed information about the [science behind the challenge](https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/docs/pages/overview.html#problem-setting), the [specifics of the data](https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/docs/pages/data.html), and [documents the code](https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/docs/rst_source/modules.html) used to facilitate the evaluation of the competition. It also describes the [evaluation metric](https://fair-universe.lbl.gov/docs/pages/evaluation.html)

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/FAIR-Universe/HEP-Challenge/tree/master/): This hosts the code for testing submissions, as well as the [starting kit notebook](https://github.com/FAIR-Universe/HEP-Challenge/blob/master/StartingKit_HiggsML_Uncertainty_Challenge.ipynb). The starting kit is also available on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FAIR-Universe/HEP-Challenge/blob/master/StartingKit_HiggsML_Uncertainty_Challenge.ipynb)

* White Paper(coming soon): This serves as a full breakdown of the competition in detail
